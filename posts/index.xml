      <description>I currently spend a lot of my time at the command line, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d start a series on tools that are essential to my workflow. Some of these will be well known tools, and others less so, but hopefully there&amp;rsquo;s something useful for everyone!
xmllint What is it? xmllint is a command line XML tool.
How do I get it? It&amp;rsquo;s built in to MacOS (ships with the libxml2 package) ðŸŽ‰</description>

      <title>Adding a progress bar to your Python script</title>

      <description>The problem? You&amp;rsquo;re writing a Python script which carries out some tasks in a loop. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re processing data in a bunch of files, or scraping a list of websites. Whatever it is, the task takes anything from a few seconds to a few minutes to complete. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be great if you could visualise progress (in the command line no less!) easily, and without some ugly print() statements in your code?</description>

      <title>Getting PyCharm to work with pyenv local</title>

      <description>I write the majority of my code in Sublime Text, favouring it over a full blown IDE like PyCharm or Eclipse. However, I cannot argue with the debugging abilities that an IDE provides.
Recently I tried to use PyCharm&amp;rsquo;s debugging functionality, and although when adding the folder as a PyCharm project and specifying the relevant pyenv virtualenv1 Python path (see image below), PyCharm just could not seem to find it.</description>

      <title>Setting up pyenv and pyenv-virtualenv</title>

      <description>I have a confession to make; I&amp;rsquo;ve only been using Python virtualenvs for about 6 months (I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with Python for ~2 years now).
To be honest, by the time I&amp;rsquo;d been introduced to them, I&amp;rsquo;d already royally screwed up my default Python&amp;rsquo;s site-packages, and I was developing on Windows, so virtualenvs just seemed like a lot of hassle. Anyway, everything mostly seemed to sort of work, so why change anything, right?</description>

      <title>Copy to the clipboard in Vim</title>

      <description>I love using Vim for making quick changes to files when I&amp;rsquo;m working on the command line. I even use the Vim keyboard shortcuts in Sublime Text, and these days I struggle to use any text editor that does not allow me to enable Vim key bindings.
Recently, I found myself needing to copy text to the clipboard from a text file that I had open in Vim. I am pretty ashamed to say that I didn&amp;rsquo;t think there&amp;rsquo;d be a key combination to allow me to do this, so I always resorted to using the mouse.</description>
