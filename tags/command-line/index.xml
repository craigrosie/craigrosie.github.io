      <description>The other day I was making some maintenance changes across a bunch of different git repos, and for each change I need to open a Merge Request in GitLab. This meant that I needed to browse to each repo&amp;rsquo;s page in GitLab, which is not too bad if the git hosting software you&amp;rsquo;re using is speedy, however our instance of GitLab was&amp;hellip; not.
After sitting watching the GitLab loading bar for seconds at a time, I thought &amp;ldquo;there must be a better way to do this from the command line&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>I currently spend a lot of my time at the command line, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d start a series on tools that are essential to my workflow. Some of these will be well known tools, and others less so, but hopefully there&amp;rsquo;s something useful for everyone!
xmllint What is it? xmllint is a command line XML tool.
How do I get it? It&amp;rsquo;s built in to MacOS (ships with the libxml2 package) ðŸŽ‰</description>
