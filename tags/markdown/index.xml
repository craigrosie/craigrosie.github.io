      <description>If you work in tech, chances are that you&amp;rsquo;ve had to write some Markdown documents, and it is also reasonably likely that you&amp;rsquo;ve had to upload those Markdown documents to Github.
Github (and other git-hosting sites) provide quite a decent in-browser Markdown editor, but for anything other than the smallest of changes, it can be quicker to use your day-to-day code editor.
If you use vim, you might be wondering how you can preview the Markdown you&amp;rsquo;re writing to see exactly what it will look like once you&amp;rsquo;ve committed and pushed to Github.</description>
